### Developing an machine learning model to predict whether a free plan user would convert to a paid subscriber or not. 


<sub>For this project, we have chosen the Real-Time data set from the 365 Data Science learning platform. There are 11 datasets in the CSV format. And the datasets are heavily imbalanced.</sub>
